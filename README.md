# NotebookLM Evaluation for University Use
# Open Notebook

An open source, privacy-focused alternative to Google's Notebook LM. Why give Google more of our data when we can take control of our own research workflows?

In a world dominated by Artificial Intelligence, having the ability to think üß† and acquire new knowledge üí°, is a skill that should not be a privilege for a few, nor restricted to a single company.

Open Notebook empowers you to manage your research, generate AI-assisted notes, and interact with your content‚Äîon your terms.

### üìù Notebook Page

Three intuitive columns to streamline your work:
1. **Sources**: Manage all research materials.
2. **Notes**: Create or AI-generate notes.
3. **Chat**: Chat with the AI, leveraging your content.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Context Configuration

Take control of your data. Decide what gets sent to the AI with three context options:
- No context
- Summary only
- Full content

Plus, you can add your project description to help the AI provide more accurate and helpful responses.

### üîç Integrated Search for Your Items

Locate anything across your research with ease using full-text and vector-based search.

### üí¨ Powerful open prompts

Jinja based prompts that are easy to customize to your own preferences.


## üåü Roadmap

- **Enhanced Citations**: Improved layout and finer control for citations.
- **Better Embeddings & Summarization**: Smarter ways to distill information.
- **Multiple Chat Sessions**: Juggle different discussions within the same notebook.
- **Live Front-End Updates**: Real-time UI updates for a smoother experience.
- **Async Processing**: Faster UI through asynchronous content processing.
- **Cross-Notebook Sources and Notes**: Reuse research notes across projects.
- **Bookmark Integration**: Integrate with your favorite bookmarking app.
- **Multi-model support**: Open AI, Anthropic, Vertex AI, Open Router, Ollama, etc. ‚úÖ 0.0.2
- **Insight Generation**: New tools for creating insights - [transformations](docs/TRANSFORMATIONS.md) ‚úÖ 0.0.3
- **Podcast Generator**: Automatically convert your notes into a podcast format.  ‚úÖ 0.0.4


## üíª Tech Stack

- **Streamlit**: For the front-end (Looking to move out of Streamlit. Contributors welcome!).
- **SurrealDB**: Fast, scalable database solution.
- **Langchain/Langgraph**: The backbone for LLM interactions.
- **Podcastfy**: For generating podcasts from your notes.


## üôå Help Wanted

We would love your contributions! Specifically, we're looking for help with:
- **Front-End Development**: Improve the UI/UX by moving beyond Streamlit.
